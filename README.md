This course covers advanced programming techniques in object-oriented programming, functional programming, and concurrent programming. For programming assignments, we use the Scala programming language which combines all these programming styles. In addition to learning advanced programming techniques, this course covers important techniques in software development such as code review, version control, and testing.
